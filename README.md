<h1>(Minimal)Cub3D</h1>

<p><strong>Cub3D</strong> is a project developed at 42 Porto as part of the <em>Computer Graphics</em> curriculum. Inspired by the classic <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, this project explores the <em>raycasting</em> technique to render a 3D environment from a 2D map without relying on advanced graphics libraries. This is a minimalistic implementation, focusing on the core mechanics rather than complex visual effects.</p>

<h2>üìå Project Objectives</h2>

<ul>
    <li>Implement a rendering engine based on <em>raycasting</em> to simulate a three-dimensional environment.</li>
    <li>Explore image manipulation, ray projection, and trigonometric calculations to determine depth and perspective.</li>
    <li>Manage input events (movement and interactions) and collision detection within the environment.</li>
    <li>Work with <em>MiniLibX</em>, a simple graphics library that allows handling windows, events, and images in C.</li>
</ul>

<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used</h2>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Language:</strong> C</li>
    <li><strong>Graphics Library:</strong> MiniLibX</li>
    <li><strong>Algorithms:</strong> Raycasting, angle calculation, vector normalization</li>
    <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Dynamic allocation and prevention of <em>memory leaks</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>üîç Challenges Faced</h2>

<p>Implementing <em>raycasting</em> from scratch brought interesting challenges, from understanding how to properly cast rays to optimizing rendering for smooth performance. Working with MiniLibX was also a unique experience, requiring manual control of window and event management. While the graphics are intentionally minimalistic, the focus was on functionality, collision detection, and movement mechanics, making this a strong foundation for more complex rendering projects.</p>
